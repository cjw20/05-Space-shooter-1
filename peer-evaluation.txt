Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/jermaldo/05-Space-Shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I learned how to rotate a sprite using player input.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 I liked how the game tracked multiple things in the lower left corner.

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
You could make it so the meteors bounce of the edges of the window so that they do not disapear before the player can shoot them.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
There are almost no comments explaining how the code works.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The kill_asteroid function did not make sense to me. I am unsure of what it actually does.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Instructions on how to play the game would be useful.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I like how you implemented controls for the ship.
